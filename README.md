# Project 1: Marketing Campaign 

Portfolio Project 1: Cleaning the "Marketing Campaign" Dataset 

In this project I cleaned a dataset from Kaggle named "Marketing Campaign" in MySQL Workbench.

Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodsaldanha/arketing-campaign 

Summary of Steps:
* Started with creating a database 
* Imported dataset using "Table Data Import Wizard"
* Changed column names to have cleaner and/or clearer descriptions as needed
* Combined Child_Home and Teen_Home columns into one column named "Children"
* Checked if there are any duplicates in Customer ID
* Replaced empty cells with NULL values in Income column
